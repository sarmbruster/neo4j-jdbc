If your database uses authenticate don't forget to provide login and password here.

To include a Cypher query in your workflow, add a `Database|Read/Write|Database Reader` node to your workflow and connect
it to the "Database Connecter" from above. Your Cypher statement goes to the database reader's `SQL Statement` field:
