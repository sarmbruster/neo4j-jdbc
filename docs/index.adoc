== Technical Reference

=== Usage Examples


=== The Bolt Driver

The bolt driver connects to any Neo4j 3.x database that has the binary "bolt" transport enabled.

It uses the [neo4j-java-driver] to provide the connectivity.

Just provide your username and password and you can connect to Neo4j.

The JDBC URL has this format: `jdbc:neo4j:bolt://host:port;username=neo4j,password=xxxx`

=== The HTTP Driver

The http driver uses the existing (since Neo4j 2.x) transaction Cypher http API, and is implemented using apache commons httpclient and jackson for JSON (de)serialization.

The JDBC URL has this format: `jdbc:neo4j:http://host:port;username=neo4j,password=xxxx`

=== JDBC Compatibility

We cover these aspects of the JDBC-APIs, everything that's not explicitely mentioned should be assumed to be not implemented:

* Driver handling automatic loading and JDBC URLs
* Connection, incl. autocommit and manual commit
* Transactions
* Statements for reads and writes
* PreparedStatement for reads and writes, including parameters, both question marks `?` and named numbered parameters `{1}`
* ResultSet retrieving all columns as String, Object and their native type with optional conversions
